## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a path-planning tool to assist with urban navigation, similar to GPS-based systems like Google Maps, with an emphasis on environmentally sustainable and resilient mobility alternatives. The tool is designed to provide various functionalities that enhance urban mobility, such as:

- **Fastest Route**: Identifying the fastest route to the destination.
- **Second-Fastest Independent Route**: Providing an alternative route that is independent from the fastest route.
- **Restricted Route Planning**: Supporting the planning of routes that exclude specific nodes or segments.
- **Environmentally-Friendly Routes**: Generating routes that combine driving and walking, including parking options, to reduce environmental impact.

The tool also accommodates constraints such as the unavailability of certain routes, ensuring practical and versatile solutions for diverse mobility needs. The ultimate goal of the project is to deliver a navigation system that prioritizes both efficiency and sustainability in urban mobility.
